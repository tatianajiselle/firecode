Practice Interview Problems. Also see HackerRank Repository.

Problems are listed by topic. Note some problems topics overlap.
Firecode.io is a reiterating programming tool used to test and prepare for essential topics seen in interviews.

There are 5 levels to firecode, and 137 java questions.
I have completed up to level 3.

*Note: Directory "offline" contains questions from CodingBat, not Firecode. I decided to add it to this repository to eliminate excess repositories.
